Description: Through the correlation analysis between samples, we can observe the 
             biological repetition between samples in the group. At the same time,
             the higher the correlation coefficient between the samples in the group
             and the samples in the group, the more reliable the obtained differential
             metabolites are. Pearson's correlation coefficient R (Pearson's 
             correlation coefficient) is used as the evaluation index of biological 
             repetition correlation. Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated by 
             the built-in cor function of R software. The closer |r| is to 1, the 
             stronger the correlation between two duplicate samples is.
